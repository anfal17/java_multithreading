-->Locks are used to prevent race conttion and maitnain the integrity of the program

-->To handle crirtical sections where multiple processes/threads are working on them

-->mututal exclusion principles

-->two types of Locks
1.Intrincsic 
-> built in , automatic , (syncronized keyword)

2.Explicit   
-> manually control over locking and unlocking,
 java.util.concurrent.Locks


//synchronised allows other threads to access only after a thread has completed execution


//using Lock class
.lock()    ---> wait until get
.trylock()  --> wait for soemtime else skip 
.unlock() 


ReentrantLock ??
